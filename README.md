By: Saul

This project is a work in progress smart mirror webapp.

## Features
Current:
-Minimal voice commands
-Weather Underground display for a pre-determined location

Goals:
-Google calendar integration

## Commands
The smart mirror used Annyang, Chrome speech synthesis, and api.ai to provide a smart assistant within the mirror.
Start all commands with:   
``` Alexa, ... ```  
or  
``` Hey Alexa, ... ```  
Examples:
``` Hey Alexa, what's the weather like next teusday?  
Alexa, when's your birthday?  
Alexa, show me the forecast. ```  

To return to the "home screen" just say, ```Thanks Alexa```

## Compatibility
Any device running chrome with access to the microphone. (Not iOS)
Currently testing on a Galaxy Tab 10.1, and desktop computer.
